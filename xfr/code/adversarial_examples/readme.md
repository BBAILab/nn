# Adversarial Examples

The six sets of adversarial examples are contained in a zip file, which can be downloaded by clicking on the link below.   The zip file contains six CSV files, one for each adversarial example type.  
In each file, the first element is an integer representing the true label of the MNIST image.  The reamining 784 floating-point elements represent the image.  These, obviously, need to be reshaped into a 28 by 28 array for viewing, for example, with <span style="font-family:'Courier New'>"matplotlib</span.
