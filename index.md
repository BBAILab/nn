# Neural Network Research by Bradley and Blossom

This site is a repository that contains ancillary content for the research of James R. Bradley and A. Paul Blossom focusing on 
generating adversarial examples for neural networks for the purposes of:

- Measuring neural network robustness
- Adversarial training
- Advancing fairness and equity of the application of neural networks by considering the human persepctive

Each paper has its own landing page, which contains links to the associated content:

1. [Generating Adversarial Examples for Visual Similarity, Counterfactuals, and the Measurement of Robustness](./gae_ga/){:target="_blank"}
2. [The Transferability of Adversarial Examples Within and Across Neural Network Architectures](./xfr/){:target="_blank"}
