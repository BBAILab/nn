# Madry et al. Neural Network Models and Code

This folder contains code that we ahve modified from that posted by Madry et al. at in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/MadryLab/mnist_challenge

Multiple subfolder each contain a different set of self contained files, one for each of these tasks:

- Generating adversarial examples
- Evaluating/predicting the classification of adverarial examples generated using the method from Madry et al.
