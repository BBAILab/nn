# Genetic Algorithm Code

This folder contains one version of the genetic algorithm code used for generating adversarial examples.  Slight differences were required for the Feed Forward (FF) neural networks versus 
the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accommodate different input shapes.  We present just one of these versions of the code which is almost entirely the same.

The code was written as a command line program and, while developed on a Windows computer, it was deployed on a Unix-based high performance computing cluster at William & Mary.  A sample of 
a command line statement to execute the code is also given.
